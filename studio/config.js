	At Dawn Studio — deployment configuration
	=========================================
	This is the ONLY file you need to edit when deploying.

	adminPasswordHash:
		SHA-256 hex of the producer/admin password.
		The default password is:  atdawn2026
		To change it, open admin.html -> Settings -> "Change admin password",
		which generates the new hash for you to paste below.

	vdoPath:
		Path from the /studio/ folder to the VDO.Ninja install.
		"../" is correct when /studio/ lives inside the VDO.Ninja web root.
		You may also use an absolute URL (e.g. "https://vdo.yourdomain.com/").
