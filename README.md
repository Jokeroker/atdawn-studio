# At Dawn Studio

**A producer-friendly control room and Zoom-simple guest experience for live broadcasts,
built on top of a self-hosted [VDO.Ninja](https://vdo.ninja).**

At Dawn Studio wraps VDO.Ninja's peer-to-peer video engine in a purpose-built workflow for
running live shows: guests join through one clean link, wait in a branded waiting room, get
admitted to a green room, and are moved on air with a click — while the producer runs
everything from a single dashboard.

## What it does

- **One guest link** → name prompt → camera check → waiting room → green room → on air.
- **Control room dashboard** with a guest board: Admit, Send to broadcast, per-guest mute /
  camera / record / solo link / notes / kick, and one-click copy for every link you need.
- **Producer comms that never reach the stream:** Listen and Talk per room, IFB-style
  whisper to one guest, on-screen cues and countdown timers.
- **Live monitors** — a video thumbnail of every connected guest, right on the Overview.
- **OBS-ready outputs:** auto-mixed room scenes and per-guest solo feeds as browser sources.
- Noise gate, pro audio, on-air tally, private chat, live captions, branded standby slate,
  auto-record, huddles, and Stream Deck / Companion remote control.

**Full documentation lives in [`studio/README.md`](studio/README.md).**

## Where the code lives

Everything At Dawn Studio adds is in the [`studio/`](studio/) folder:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `studio/index.html` | Landing page — Guest or Producer |
| `studio/join.html` | Guest flow: name, camera, waiting room, on-air controls |
| `studio/admin.html` | Password-protected control room |
| `studio/config.js` · `common.js` · `studio.css` | Config, shared helpers, styling |
| `studio/README.md` | Full feature & deployment docs |

The rest of this repository is an **unmodified copy of VDO.Ninja v30.2**. It ships here
intentionally: the wrapper embeds VDO.Ninja and must be served from the **same domain**
for the dashboard and guest pages to read live state from the video frames. None of
VDO.Ninja's own source files are changed — you can update VDO.Ninja underneath the wrapper
at any time.

## Deploying

This repo is served by GitHub Pages. To push updates, run `deploy.ps1` from the project
folder — it commits, pushes, and keeps Pages enabled. See
[`studio/README.md`](studio/README.md#deploying) for details.
